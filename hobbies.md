Embarking on a journey of scientific research is a pursuit laden with both excitement and challenges; it is a path that demands the nurturing of an inner reservoir of inspiration and enlightenment. For Zhican, it is the art of **photography** and the elegance of **writing** that act as his sanctuaries of solace, which dispel the pressures inherent in rigorous academic exploration. These pursuits not only offer him a realm of relaxation and peace but also serve as sources of renewed creativity and perspectives, fueling his passion for uncovering the unknown.

<br>Zhican finds serenity and joy in wandering amidst the grandeur of mountains and expanses of fields, feeling the breath of nature between stars and oceans. He also revels in traversing bustling streets, observing majestic architectures, and immersing in the allure of diverse cultures. With his cherished camera in hand—a Sony A7M4 paired with a Tamron 28-200 mm lens—he captures the essence of his experiences and the fleeting moments of beauty that surround him.

## Science Popularizing


<br>Swimming removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water. Besides, I am a member of the Swimming Team at Fuzhou University, where I meet many sincere friends. I have reached **China National Second-level athlete Standard** in 50m breaststroke and won **Five Gold Medals** during my swimming career. Recently, I am also keen on surfing.
