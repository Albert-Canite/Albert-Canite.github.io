The goal of our research is to explore and build the next-generation hardware based on post-CMOS emerging devices, e.g. memristors. From top-down, we examine the existing algorithms and determine the most crucial task to accelerate with our hardware. Examples include but not limited to matrix multiplication in A.I./machine learning tasks. In the meanwhile, we optimize and characterize the device performance, including their nonlinear dynamics, and build novel circuit/architecture/algorithm from bottom up.

1. **A.I./Machine learning hardware accelerators based on emerging devices.**

From the system-level, we plan to develop PICs with on-chip lasers for applications of communications and interconnects, OPA-based LiDAR, Bio-chemical sensors, quantum information processing and optical computing, etc.

2. **Emerging materials for new devices**
